[Live Project](https://fullstacksammy-battleships.herokuapp.com/)

The all time classic Battleships game is a fun game that runs in a Python terminal. It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The player has 10 turns to sink all the enemy ships (the computer is the enemy). There are 5 battleships that occupy a single space on the board.
